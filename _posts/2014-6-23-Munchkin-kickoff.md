title: Rebuilding Munchkin Android
categories: [MunchkinAndroid, coding]

Recently I've been trying to find a project that I could dig into coding wise in an attempt to try out new designs. However, there really isn't much that I'm that passionate about making new in the app world. I think that comes with the fact that I've been making Android Apps professionally for a while now. The grind becomes part of the day. It stops being this thing that you look at new and exciting.

So in an attempt to get back to some exciting roots and also to try out new ideas I decided that I'm going to rework Munchkin Android. Munchkin Android is a app that had a simple goal and I made overly complex. I didn't know anything about UX design and my code design wasn't much better. The last APK that was uploaded was June 12, 2012. Which is over two years ago. I feel that I've grown a lot since then as a developer so I'm curious what I can do with my old concept.

Just to document how bad the app is right now it has an average rating of 3.57 with 77 reviews. I don't plan to re-launch the app as a whole so it'll be interesting to see how the re-design actually works.

This project also started out as a way to demonstrate concepts so it was going to be "open source." In reality it was never open source. I posted snapshots of the code on github but it was never the latest and the greatest. My current hope to release the re-design as free software for what I write. I'll be using libraries for various tasks but in general you are free to do as you which with the code without accreditation. This includes re-releasing the app if you want to.

The goal isn't to make money or attention but rather to attempt to make a great product and perhaps teach in the process.
