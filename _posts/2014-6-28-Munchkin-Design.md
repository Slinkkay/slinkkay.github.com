The Munchkin Android redesign has slowly been progressing as I've been trying to consider what I 
want it to do and how it should react. The current featureset has some overreaching aspects that 
aren't really needed. So for the re-design some of the fight features are going to be dropped until 
a further date. The general use of the app will remain the same in terms of the level and gear
tracking. The images below are some early sketches for how the app is going to be structured.

The overall feel of the app is going to be a left and right movement with the summary acting as 
a home screen of sorts. There are parts missing from this setup such as level add and subtract 
but that will be updated in due time.
